# Original intention

# This Java attempt

# Challenges

## Smack Api changes

## Vines differing handling of multiple connections

## Impedance mismatch between Mockito and JMock

# Key lessons

## Keeping the tests real simple and lean

## Defining variables in unit tests final!

## Loose verifications

    verify(auction, times(1)).bid(price + increment);
    verify(sniperListener, atLeastOnce()).sniperBidding();

Although didn't fail when introducing show winning functionality

## The whole JMock allowances / status functionality

## The value of a supporting to do list to prevent flow breakage
